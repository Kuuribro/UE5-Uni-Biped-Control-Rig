# UE5 Universal Biped Ctrl Rig
 
A Control Rig designed for Bipeds of any skeleton. Use Control Rig with your existing characters without starting from scratch!


Designed to work with (hopefully) any existing biped characters.

As many projects use custom skeletal hierarchies, this one is NOT limited to the Epic Skeleton!

Contains an Unreal Mannequin to show functionality with the Epic Skeleton, and an example character with extra features such as Y-oriented bones, Texture-offset material eyes, blend shapes and procedural secondary bones. Fully functional with Backwards Solve as well!

Blueprint contains instructions on setup.

Explore animating in sequencer with Control Rig with a flexible setup that should accommodate characters from all across the internet or in your existing projects.
